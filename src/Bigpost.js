            Long-form content, such as blog posts, requires careful consideration to ensure it's
            readable and easy to follow. In this article, we will explore how to use Tailwind CSS

          <h2>What is Tailwind Typography?</h2>
          <p>
            The *Tailwind Typography plugin* provides a set of utility classes for styling
            long-form content. It applies sensible defaults for fonts, line heights, colors, and
            spacing, which are commonly needed for readable content.

          <h3>Why is Typography Important?</h3>
          <p>
            Proper typography ensures that your content is not only aesthetically pleasing but also
            highly readable. For blog posts, articles, or documentation, typography directly impacts
            how comfortable it is for readers to engage with your content.
